## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive set of solutions for the Isograd coding challenges, facilitating learning and improvement for participants of the MDF 2025 review.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have a solution or improvement, please submit a pull request. I code mainly in Python, so I'll focus on Python solutions. In general, it's also the only language for which Isograd always provides a solution (seriously, who does coding challenges in COBOL?).
